## Binary files

Avoid adding binary files to the repository. If a binary file is needed, minimize its size and accompany it with a markdown file that 
describes the binary file and how it was created.

## Documentation

1. Documentation in the repository (all .md files) should be clear, consistent, concise and up-to-date.
2. Documentation should not contain details that are easy to infer from the code.
3. If code does not match the documentation, there should be TODO comments in the code to signal the discrepancy should be resolved.
4. For documentation use [sentence case for headings](https://developers.google.com/style/capitalization#capitalization-in-titles-and-headings).

## Shell scripts

To run a script in `tool/`:

- If you are on mac and use VS Code, open the script and press `⇧⌘B` (see [.vscode/tasks.json](../../.vscode/tasks.json)).
- Otherwise, you can invoke the scripts on the command line from any directory.

## pubspec.lock files

`pubspec.lock` files are not git ignored to make the bots faster.

If you include `pubspec.lock` file to your PR, make sure to run `flutter pub upgrade`,
when your Flutter is using the latest version of the beta channel (run `flutter channel beta && flutter upgrade` to make sure you're on the right one).
